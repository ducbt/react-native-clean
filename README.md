### The Clean Architecture for React Native

This is an example of implementing Uncle Bobs Clean Architecture --> where everything is a plugin. 

For example the phone storage is abstracted using an interface and the web is hidden behid a repository! 

Also of interest are the presenters which hide encapsulate the view behaviour (in a viewmodel).

The testing is done a use-case basis!
